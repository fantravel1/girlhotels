                    <p><strong>I was supposed to be celebrating my 35th birthday in Cabo with my partner of six years. Instead, I was standing alone at a hotel check-in desk in Paris, trying not to cry, wondering what I was doing.</strong></p>

                    <p>The breakup had happened three weeks before my birthday. Instead of canceling everything and hiding at home, I did something impulsive: I rebooked. Same dates, different destination. No beach resort for two—a solo adventure in Paris, the city I'd been dreaming about since I was a teenager reading French novels in my childhood bedroom.</p>

                    <p>"Room for Thompson?" I said to the receptionist at Hotel des Grands Boulevards. She looked at my passport, looked at me—undoubtedly seeing mascara that had migrated during the overnight flight—and smiled warmly. "Bienvenue, Madame. And is it a special occasion?"</p>

                    <p>I hesitated. Then: "It's my birthday tomorrow."</p>

                    <p>"Bon anniversaire! We will make it special."</p>

                    <p>Reader, they did. But so did I.</p>

                    <h2>Why I Chose Paris—and Why It Was Right</h2>

                    <p>Paris has a reputation as a couples' city. The kissing on bridges, the candlelit dinners, the whole romance industrial complex. I was worried it would make me feel worse.</p>

                    <p>What I discovered was different. Paris, it turns out, is a city built for the solo wanderer. The flaneur tradition—the art of aimless, pleasurable strolling—is embedded in its DNA. Nobody rushes. Nobody expects you to be doing anything other than existing, observing, absorbing beauty. For the first time in years, I had permission to just... be.</p>

                    <div class="pullquote">"I realized I'd been waiting for someone to take me to Paris. I could have taken myself all along."</div>

                    <p>I spent hours in the Musée d'Orsay without checking the time. I sat in Luxembourg Gardens with a book until the light faded. I had dinner at the bar of a bistro in Le Marais where the chef asked my name and remembered it the next night. These weren't compromises or consolation prizes—they were exactly what I wanted.</p>

                    <h2>The Birthday Itself</h2>

                    <p>I woke up on my 35th birthday in a room with blue velvet curtains and a balcony overlooking Parisian rooftops. The hotel had left a small cake and a card that said "Joyeux Anniversaire Maya." I cried—but this time, from something that felt like gratitude.</p>

                    <p>My self-prescribed birthday itinerary:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Morning:</strong> Croissants at Du Pain et des Idées, then a walk through the Canal Saint-Martin</li>
                        <li><strong>Afternoon:</strong> A solo tasting menu at Septime (I'd booked months ago for the original trip—decided to keep it)</li>
                        <li><strong>Evening:</strong> Champagne at sunset on Pont Alexandre III, then wandering until my feet gave out</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="tip-box">
                        <p><strong>🍽️ Solo dining tip:</strong> At Septime, I requested counter seating when I rebooked for one. The kitchen view transformed the meal into a performance. Many high-end restaurants prefer single diners at the bar—ask when booking.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>At Septime, somewhere around the third course, something shifted. I was watching the kitchen work, sipping natural wine, savoring each bite without having to make conversation or share or explain why I wanted to try everything. The flavors were mine alone. The experience was complete, not half of something.</p>

                    <p>A woman at the next seat—also dining alone—caught my eye and raised her glass. "Birthday?" she asked. I nodded. "Brave," she said. "And right." We talked for the next hour. She was a novelist from São Paulo, in Paris for research. We exchanged emails. A friendship that started over shared solitude.</p>

                    <h2>What I Learned About Traveling Solo</h2>

                    <h3>The Logistics Matter Less Than You Think</h3>

                    <p>I had anxiety about safety, about navigating alone, about looking like a lost tourist. But Paris is incredibly manageable. The Metro is intuitive. English is widely spoken but French efforts are appreciated. I never felt unsafe—even walking home alone at midnight through the Marais.</p>

                    <p>My hotel helped: Hotel des Grands Boulevards felt like a stylish friend's apartment. The staff gave me a map with their personal recommendations circled in pen. They texted me when they heard about a pop-up natural wine bar. They made me feel known.</p>

                    <h3>The Real Luxury Is Your Own Schedule</h3>

                    <p>Solo travel is selfish in the best possible way. Tired? Nap. Hungry? Eat. Want to spend three hours in a single room of a museum? Nobody is waiting. This might sound obvious, but after years of compromising, negotiating, planning around someone else—the freedom was revolutionary.</p>

                    <h3>You Meet People When You're Open</h3>

                    <p>I was worried about loneliness. Instead, I found connection. The novelist at Septime. The American expat at my hotel who invited me to her gallery opening. The elderly Parisian woman who helped me order at a boulangerie and ended up walking with me for an hour, telling me about living through May '68.</p>

                    <p>Traveling with a partner creates a bubble. Solo, you're porous. The world gets in.</p>

                    <h2>The Hotels That Made It Special</h2>

                    <p>I chose accommodations that would embrace rather than pity a single traveler. This was crucial.</p>

                    <h3>Hotel des Grands Boulevards</h3>
                    <p>This became my Paris home base. A former 18th-century mansion turned design hotel, with a rooftop restaurant that felt like a neighborhood secret. The staff were warm without being intrusive—they seemed to understand that solo travelers need community and solitude in equal measure. My small "cozy" room was perfectly adequate; I spent most of my time in the lush courtyard anyway.</p>

                    <h3>Mama Shelter Paris (for comparison)</h3>
                    <p>I'd stayed at Mama Shelter on a previous trip and considered it for this one. It's more social, more party, more young energy. For a contemplative birthday trip, Hotel des Grands Boulevards was right. But if you want to meet people easily, Mama Shelter's communal spaces are designed for exactly that.</p>

                    <div class="tip-box">
                        <p><strong>🏨 Solo hotel tip:</strong> Look for hotels with great lobby or bar scenes. You want spaces to be alone in public—watching, working, reading—without pressure to be social. But the option should be there.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Would I Do It Again?</h2>

                    <p>I'm going back to Paris for my 36th birthday. This time not because I need to—but because I want to. I've already booked the same room at Hotel des Grands Boulevards. The staff remembered me when I called.</p>

                    <p>Here's what that trip taught me: I had been treating solo travel as a last resort, a thing you do when plans fall through. Now I understand it differently. A solo trip is a gift you give yourself. It's not about being alone—it's about being fully present in your own life.</p>

                    <p>My 35th birthday was supposed to be a disaster. It became a turning point. Standing on Pont Alexandre III that evening, watching the Eiffel Tower light up, champagne in hand, I made a promise to myself: I would stop waiting for permission to live the life I wanted.</p>

                    <p>Paris gave me that. But really, I gave it to myself.</p>
